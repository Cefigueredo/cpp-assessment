# C++ Technical Assessment

Owner: Carlos Figueredo - Software Engineer

This project is a technical assessment. The project is a C++ application that reads a file in format XML or JSON containing a list of employees. It calculates the average salary of the employees, prints the employees with the highest salary and displays the employees ordered by ID.

This project was developed on a Macbook Pro with macOS Sonoma 14.3.1 and chip M1 Pro. The project was developed using C++20 in Visual Studio Code.

# Instructions

1. You'll need jq to run the project. You can install it using brew:
```bash
brew install jq
```
2. You'll need to have g++ installed. You can install it using brew:
```bash
brew install gcc
```
3. Clone the repository
4. Open the project in Visual Studio Code
5. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code
6. Give permission to the scripts to compile and run the project:
```bash
chmod +x build.sh run.sh validate_xml.sh validate_json.sh test.sh
```

7. Compile the project:
```bash
./build.sh
```

8. Run the project with a file in XML or JSON format and an output file in txt. You can use the next command to run the project with the employees.xml file in the data/ folder and output.txt file in the root folder:
```bash
./run.sh data/employees.xml output.txt
```

9. To test the project, you can run the next command (if you want to add cases, add the respective output file in the output_test/ folder with the expected output. Also, specify the case in the test.sh file.):
```bash
./test.sh
```

If you want to use your own file, you can create a new file in the data/ folder and follow the next format for XML:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<employees>
    <employee>
        <name>Karl Fix</name>
        <id>103</id>
        <department>Engineering</department>
        <salary>100001</salary>
    </employee>
    <employee>
        <name>John Doe</name>
        <id>101</id>
        <department>HR</department>
        <salary>50000</salary>
    </employee>
</employees>
```

Or follow the next format for JSON:
```json
{
    "employees": [
        {
            "name": "Karl Fix",
            "id": 103,
            "department": "Engineering",
            "salary": 100001
        },
        {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "id": 101,
            "department": "HR",
            "salary": 50000
        }
    ]
}
```
